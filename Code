# Step 1: Install necessary packages (only need to run once)
install.packages("BaylorEdPsych")  # For Little's MCAR test
install.packages("mice")  # For missing data visualization

# Step 2: Load the libraries
library(BaylorEdPsych)
library(mice)

# Step 3: Load your dataset into R
# Assuming the dataset file is in CSV format and named "DataSet_No_Details.csv"
# Replace the file path with the location where your dataset is saved
df <- read.csv("DataSet_No_Details(1).csv")

# Step 4: Perform Little's MCAR test
mcar_test <- LittleMCAR(df)

# Step 5: View the results of the MCAR test
print(mcar_test)

# Step 6: Interpretation of results
# If p-value > 0.05, data is MCAR (Missing Completely at Random)
# If p-value <= 0.05, data is not MCAR, and might be MAR (Missing at Random) or MNAR (Missing Not at Random)
